Hi, I’m Max Pietrykowski — a data analyst with a strong foundation in economics and an M.S. in Business Analytics. I specialize in turning raw data into clear, actionable insights through statistical modeling, automation, and visualization.

My experience spans finance, logistics, and sports analytics, where I’ve led projects in predictive modeling, customer segmentation, and operational efficiency. I work primarily with Python, SQL, R Studio, and Tableau, and I thrive on solving complex problems with clean, impactful solutions.

Always curious, always learning — let’s connect and build something data-driven.
